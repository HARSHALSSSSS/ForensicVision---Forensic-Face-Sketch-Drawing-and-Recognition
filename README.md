## DESCRIPTION/ABSTRACT
ForensicVision: Sketch Drawing & Analysis Tool

In forensic science, it is seen that hand-drawn face sketches are still very limited and time-consuming when it comes to using them with the latest technologies used for recognition and identification of criminals.
ForensicVision is an innovative application that combines the art of sketching with artificial intelligence to assist law enforcement agencies and forensic teams. By bridging manual sketching techniques and modern AI technologies, this tool helps streamline the process of identifying individuals from forensic sketches, reducing the time and effort required for investigations.

Overview
Forensic sketches have been a cornerstone of criminal investigations for decades. However, traditional methods often rely solely on human expertise and manual processes. ForensicVision takes a step forward by introducing technology to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of forensic sketching and recognition.

This tool enables forensic artists and investigators to draw suspect sketches, analyze them using AI algorithms, and match them with existing databases for potential identification.

Key Features
Interactive Drawing Interface:
A clean and user-friendly interface for creating accurate forensic sketches.
AI-Powered Recognition:
Employs advanced computer vision models to analyze sketches and find matches in real-time.
Cloud-Based Storage:
Sketches and associated data are securely stored using Firebase for easy collaboration and access.
Detailed Reporting:
Generates comprehensive reports to assist investigators in presenting evidence.
Scalable Design:
Optimized to handle large datasets and integrate with external databases for enhanced search capabilities.
